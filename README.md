# dnd-scripts
We're playing D&amp;D 3.5 through Roll20.net and we need some little helpers to manage all the stuff.

== character_sheet_pdf.rb (v0.1.0)
 [Work in Progress] Generate an Character Sheet in PDF Format (with prawn).

== sb.rb (v0.1.0)
 [Work in Progress] Has to be renamed soon. Define your Character in some sort of DSL as class to use in other scripts.
